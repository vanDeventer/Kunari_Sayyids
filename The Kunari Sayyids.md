## Foreword and acknowledgements
What is in front of you is my second endeavor, which as been to chronicle the lives and contexts of the Sayyid of Kunar.
The first endeavor was to fulfill a request from a family to find a connection from our family, the Sayyids of Kunar, back to the prophet Muhammad. 

Thanks to the Internet and Wikipedia, tracing the lineage has been much easier and detailed than first imagined.
Well, that is for the Arabian part of it.
It is so thoroughly well done that here is no reason for us to challenge the period that contain the prophet himself, his ancestors, and the following Twelve Imams.

Sparser are the information around the progenitors of the Sayyids, Sayyid Ali Akbar (~868-926 CE), who who exiled to Termez, a town in today’s southern part of Uzbekistan along the Amu Darya River, that gave name to the descendant *Termezi*, meaning ‘of Termez’.
Then, Sayyid Ali Termezi (1502-1583 CE), and his father, Sayyid Qanbar Ali, (pronounced Qambar) joined forces with Babur, the king of Kabulistan and later becoming the first Mughal emperor of India. Up to this point it is all on Wikipedia, however beyond this point it is sparse and I had to search and being fortunate to find authors dealing with Afghanistan’s history during that timeframe.

The herewith manuscript is nothing more than a collection of references to the works done by real field researchers and all praise is going to them and their work that enrich our knowledge.
You will find a collection of URLs, such that it is best read on an Internet connected computer.
A URL (Uniform Resource Locator) is a unique identifier used to locate a resource on the Internet. 
It is also referred to as a web address.

## Introduction: 
As earlier stated, my first task was to find out the connection between the now living family members and the possible link to the prophet Muhammad, which in itself a challenge to tackle. 
This quest became less strenuous than expected because Wikipedia could guide me step by step and generation by generation,  from the prophet Muhammad and his descendants over centuries down to Sayyid Ali Termezi, better known as [Pir Baba](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pir_Baba), our progenitor.

Additionally Wikipedia inspired me to go back in time to learn more about the prophet’s ancestors consolidating the environmental picture of that time.
This is important to me since details fade.
Similar to a perspective painting, , what lies nearest to us holds the greatest significance, gradually lessening in importance as it extends outward, until it eventually fades into obscurity. 
The same is to know about the nearest family connection, such as parents, grandparents and so on back in time – and that is what the following is about.
Without the details, it is hard to understand why some went into exile or why certain alliances were formed.

Thanks to two independent genealogies family documents that shows a common line of ancestors from Sayyid Ali Termezi, known as Pir Baba, through his son, Mustafa, followed by Abdel-Wahab, Jamal-Uddin, Abbas, Abd-Allah, and Abdullatif to Sayyid Muhammad Nazif where two branches separate as follows: 
The ruling line of the Sayyids as ‘Pad-shah of Kunar’ were Sayyid Baha-Uddin, Mahmud and the last ‘Pad-shah of Kunar’, Sayyid Ahmad. 
The secondary line of the Sayyids were Sayyid Muhammad Hashim (being the full brother to Bah-Uddin), Muhammad Qassim and Muhammad Ja’far.

From Pir Baba and his descendance the Internet played a more important role than Wikipedia since it became more specific looking for each person, and it must be admitted that besides only having the name of an ancestor, unfortunately more than that hasn’t been possible to find out so far – however that is a holding point for further research. 
One lucky strike was when, by chance, I searched the Internet for ‘Sayyids of Kunar’, and it opened the following site “History of Pashtuns”.

This site introduced me to two valuable sources, “A Political and Diplomatic History of Afghanistan, 1863-1901, p-69, by M. Hassan Kakar” and “State and Tribe in Nineteenth-Century Afghanistan, p-191-195, 205, by Christine Noelle”.

Let us explore the findings, starting with a map of the Eastern Province Kunar, the province that was ruled by the Sayyids for about 300 years, in which you can find the town of Kunar and the town of Pashat along the Kunar River.
